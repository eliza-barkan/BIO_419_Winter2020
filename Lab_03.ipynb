    "In Python we can do matrix algebra without having to calculate each value by hand. Given the numpy arrays `A` and `B`, `A+B` or `A-B` returns the elementwise addition or subtraction, and `A*B` returns the elementwise multiplication. *Elementwise* operations are performed on two matrices of the exact same shape, and produces an output matrix that also has the same dimensions. In elementwise addition, each value from matrix `A` is added to the single value in matrix `B` that is in the same position. Similarly, elementwise multiplication multiplies each value in `A` by the corresponding value in `B`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The elementwise addition for the following two matrices `A` and `B`, (calculated in Python as `A+B` ), looks like this:\n",
    "![Elementwise addition figure](figures/matrices_1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **matrix product** is different from elementwise matrix multiplication. A matrix product calculates the product of each value in the *rows* of the first matrix against the *columns* of the second matrix. Matrix products can only be calculated if the **number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows of the second matrix**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix product for `A` and `B` looks like this:\n",
    "![Matrix product figure](figures/matrices_2.jpg)\n",
